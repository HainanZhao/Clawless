# Clawless — Bring Your Own Agent (Interface + ACP)

Clawless is an interface bridge built around one core idea: **Bring Your Own Agent**.

Instead of forcing a built-in runtime, Clawless lets you keep your preferred local ACP-capable CLI (Gemini CLI by default) and adds a reliable interface layer, callbacks, and scheduling on top.

Today, Telegram is the first interface adapter; more interfaces are planned.

## Bring Your Own Agent (Main Value)

Clawless is designed so your messaging layer and automation layer stay stable while your agent runtime can change.

- Keep your preferred local agent CLI workflow
- Keep your existing MCP tools and local files
- Swap runtimes without rebuilding your bot integration
- Avoid lock-in to a single all-in-one framework

## Why Clawless

If you have tried heavier all-in-one agent frameworks, Clawless is the minimal alternative:

- **BYO-agent first**: use your preferred local ACP-capable CLI runtime
- **Lightweight setup**: minimal glue instead of a full platform migration
- **Local-first control**: your machine, your tools, your data flow
- **Transport only**: interface layer is separate from the agent runtime

## Interface Adapters

- **Current adapter**: Telegram
- **Planned direction**: add more interfaces without changing core agent orchestration
- **Design goal**: keep one message context contract so new interfaces reuse queueing, callbacks, scheduler, and ACP flow

## Features

- 🔀 **Bring Your Own Agent Runtime**: Keep Telegram/callback/scheduler UX while choosing your preferred local ACP-capable CLI
- 🔌 **Adapter-Friendly Interface Layer**: Telegram today, additional interfaces planned
- 🤖 **Telegram (Current Adapter)**: Interact with your local agent runtime through Telegram
- ⌨️ **Typing Status UX**: Shows Telegram typing indicator while the agent is processing
- 🛠️ **Rich Tool Support**: Leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers connected to your local CLI runtime
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Runs on your hardware, you control data flow
- 💾 **Persistent Context**: Maintains local session unlike standard API calls
- 📬 **Sequential Queueing**: Processes one message at a time to avoid overlap and races
- 🔔 **Local Callback Endpoint**: Accepts localhost HTTP POST requests and forwards payloads directly to Telegram
- ⏰ **Cron Scheduler**: Schedule tasks to run at specific times or on recurring basis via REST API

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Interface Adapter    │◄───►│   Clawless     │◄───►│ Local Agent.             │
│ (Telegram now)       │     │   (Node.js)    │ ACP │ e.g. Gemini CLI (default)│
└──────────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └──────────────────────────┘
```

The bridge:
1. Receives messages from the active interface adapter (Telegram today)
2. Forwards them to **your configured local agent CLI** via ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)
3. Sends interface-appropriate progress/status updates, then returns a single final response

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **A local ACP-capable agent CLI** installed and configured (Gemini CLI is the default setup)
- **Telegram Bot Token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) for the current Telegram adapter

## Installation

### Option A: Install from npm (compiled CLI, recommended)

Install globally:

```bash
npm i -g clawless
```

Run:

```bash
clawless
```

This uses the published compiled CLI package from npmjs, so you do not need to clone or build the project locally.

For local development and advanced runtime/operator docs, see `AGENTS.md`.

## Getting a Telegram Bot Token

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the prompts to create your bot
4. Copy the token provided by BotFather
5. Paste it into your `.env` file

## Authorizing Users (Whitelist)

For security, the bot only accepts commands from authorized users. To configure:

1. **Use your Telegram username**:
  - You can use your Telegram username (e.g., `your_username` or `@your_username`).
  - If you don't have a username set, you must create one in Telegram settings.

2. **Add usernames to whitelist** in `~/.clawless/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "telegramToken": "your_bot_token",
    "telegramWhitelist": ["your_username", "another_user"]
   }
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use environment variable**:
   ```bash
   TELEGRAM_WHITELIST='["your_username", "another_user"]'

   # Empty allowlist (blocks all users)
   TELEGRAM_WHITELIST='[]'
   ```

⚠️ **Security Note**: If `telegramWhitelist` is empty or not configured, **all users will be blocked** by default. This is a safety measure to prevent unauthorized access.

## Usage

### CLI Mode

After global install from npm (`npm i -g clawless`), run:

```bash
clawless
```

You can also run without global install:

```bash
npx clawless
```

> Note: the binary name is `clawless`.

### Config File (CLI)

On first run, the CLI automatically creates:

```text
~/.clawless/config.json
```

with placeholder values, then exits so you can edit it.

After updating placeholders, run again:

```bash
clawless
```

You can also use a custom path:

```bash
clawless --config /path/to/config.json
```

If the custom config path does not exist, a template file is created there as well.

You can still bootstrap from the example file if preferred:

```bash
cp clawless.config.example.json ~/.clawless/config.json
```

Environment variables still work and take precedence over config values.

### Run In Background

Simple background run:

```bash
nohup clawless > clawless.log 2>&1 &
```

For production hosting, use any process manager or platform you prefer (for example: systemd, PM2, Docker, or your cloud runtime).
